From the above UML Class Diagram you can see both classes "Animal" and "Pet" are abstract classes. They are the parent classes. Class "Animal" has three derived classes; "Spider", "Fish" and "Cat". They have a public inheritance type which means they inherit the public and protected members of class "Animal". The class "Pet" has two derived classes; "Fish" and "Cat".
